# World_Weather_Analysis

Module 6 Challenge

* Background
Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. And, as with any new product, they've recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data.

Use weather description data retrieved from module 06 practice acticvities to enhance the PlanMyTrip app. 
Use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
User will select four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. 
Finally, implmenting the Geoapify Routing API, create a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.
